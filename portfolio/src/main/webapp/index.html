              gingerbread is a programming language designed by Ayaz and Lukas. It is written in Haskell. It looks 
              a bit like C and Rust and is strongly typed, incorporates elements from functional programming. Maybe 
              one day it will even have lazy evaluation by default! Any contributions are warmly appreciated.
