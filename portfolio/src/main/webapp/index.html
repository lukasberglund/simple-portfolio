            <h3> STEP internship</h3>
            <div class="description"> 
              In the summer of 2020 I did a STEP internship at Google. For 12-weeks I learned javascript, 
              java, css, and html and then created a webapp with my fellow interns Winnie and Eashan.

              Gingerbread is a programming language designed by Ayaz and me. It is written in Haskell. It looks 
              a bit like C and Rust, is strongly typed, and incorporates elements from functional programming. Maybe 
              one day it will even have lazy evaluation by default! It is a work in progress and any contributions are warmly appreciated.

            <h3> Vanderbilt Effective Altruism </h3>
            <div class="description"> 
              My friend Anjay and I started Vanderbilt Effective Altruism in 2019 with the aim of spreading knowledge of how we can do the most good 
              we can among our university. We ran the arete fellowship, a one hour a week introduction to effective altruism. 24 students from 
              Vanderbilt participated. In total fellows pledge approximately $930,000 of their future income to effective charities and more than half 
              decided to pursue a career of doing good.
